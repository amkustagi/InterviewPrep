```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```


```{r cars}
library(MASS)
library(dplyr)
crabs <- tbl_df(crabs)
head(crabs, n = 3)
glimpse(crabs)
library(plyr)
d_ply(crabs, .(sp, sex),function(x) print(head(x)))

d_ply(crabs, .(sp, sex),function(x) print(lm(x$CW ~ x$CL)))

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
